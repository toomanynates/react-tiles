Allow me to configure how many tiles there are on each row. The tiles should be a responsive layout so they reposition themselves depending on the device and viewable area. Each tile contains a title on top. To the right of the title is a clickable like button shaped like a heart, Below the title is an image. Below the image is a caption. When a tile is clicked, the user is taken to a unique page that contains the title, the image, and a detailed caption area.\n",
